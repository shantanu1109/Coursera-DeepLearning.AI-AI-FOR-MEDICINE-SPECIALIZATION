## WHAT YOU WILL LEARN

-Diagnose diseases from x-rays and 3D MRI brain images.
-Predict patient survival rates more accurately using tree-based models.
-Estimate treatment effects on patients using data from randomized trials.
-Automate the task of labeling medical datasets using natural language processing.

## About this Specialization

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It‚Äôs helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients‚Äô future health, and recommend better treatments. This three-course Specialization will give you practical experience in applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine.

These courses go beyond the foundations of deep learning to teach you the nuances in applying AI to medical use cases. 

---

## Applied Learning Project
Medicine is one of the fastest-growing and important application areas, with unique challenges like handling missing data. You‚Äôll start by learning the nuances of working with 2D and 3D medical image data. You‚Äôll then apply tree-based models to improve patient survival estimates. You‚Äôll also use data from randomized trials to recommend treatments more suited to individual patients. Finally, you‚Äôll explore how natural language extraction can more efficiently label medical datasets.

### COURSE 1
### AI for Medical Diagnosis

In the first course of the AI for Medicine Specialization, you will:
- You will practice classifying diseases on chest x-rays using a neural network.
- You will practice implementing standard evaluation metrics to see how well a model performs in diagnosing diseases.
- You will prepare 3D MRI data, implement an appropriate loss function for image segmentation, and apply a pre-trained U-net model to segment tumor regions in 3D brain MRI images.
